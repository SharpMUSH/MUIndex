/// <b>Stored in resx and rendered by ICU.</b> The two halves solve different problems and the usual
/// .NET arrangement only has one of them. resx is where a translation belongs: the SDK compiles
/// <c>Messages.&lt;culture&gt;.resx</c> into a satellite assembly on its own, every
/// translation-management tool reads and writes the format, and a translator receives a file their
/// software opens rather than a C# dictionary they must not break. What resx cannot do is
/// agreement — <c>{0}</c> substitutes and nothing more — which is why the values are ICU patterns.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>One message per fact, never a sentence assembled from parts.</b> The strings this replaces
/// were concatenations — a number glued to an English fragment in English word order — and there is
/// nowhere in a concatenation for a translator to intervene without editing markup. Russian needs
/// three plural forms and Arabic six, Chinese needs a measure word, and several languages put the
/// unit before the number.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The ids are granular past the point English needs.</b> That is the whole of S7: "measured" is
/// one word here and four in Russian, chosen by what it describes, so <c>provenance.count.measured</c>
/// and <c>provenance.game.measured</c> are separate ids carrying identical English. Collapsing them
/// because the source language cannot tell them apart is exactly how a translation ends up
/// ungrammatical in three places out of four.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What is not here.</b> Game names, hostnames, codebase strings, version numbers, protocol
/// acronyms and connect-screen output never enter this file. They are the machine voice, they carry
/// <c>translate="no"</c> in the markup so a browser's own translator obeys too, and translating
